# Advent Of Code 2021

I'm on a quest to learn Clojure.

I began in September 2021. After few online tutorials, I discovered Project Euler and then Advent of Code.

These two gems have propelled my grasp of Clojure so quickly. I would highly recommend them to all.


## 2021
I'm on my own! There is no Fred Overflow to guide me when I get stuck. It is all me.

I'm no speed coder. I don't do this for the accolades. I do it for the satisfaction of figuring it out. It is one of the things I truly enjoy about coding, and particularly about learning a new language.

This is my journey through the Advent Of Code puzzles.  

My purpose for doing so is to learn Clojure.  
I'll work through the 2020 puzzles first, and then go back to 2015 until I've solved all 300.  
(I'll probably pause in the middle to solve the 2021 puzzles when December rolls around!)

Because I can't "tag" individual files, this is my attempt to track which days have examples of
types of clojure constructs, patterns, and examples so I can quickly find examples when working
on future problems.

## Day 01  
First introductions to `slurp`, `split-lines`, and `parseInt`  
`let` constructs  
nested `for` loops
