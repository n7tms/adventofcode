# Advent Of Code

This is my journey throught he Advent Of Code puzzles.  

My purpose for doing so is to learn Clojure.  
I'll work through the 2020 puzzles first, and then go back to 2015 until I've solved all 300.  
(I'll probably pause in the middle to solve the 2021 puzzles when December rolls around!)
