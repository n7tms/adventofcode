# Advent Of Code

I'm on a quest to learn Clojure.  

I began in September 2021. After few online tutorials, I discovered Project Euler and then Advent of Code.  

These two gems have propelled my grasp of Clojure so quickly. I would highly recommend them to all.  

This is my journey through the Advent Of Code puzzles. I'll work through the 2020 puzzles first, and then go back to 2015 until I've solved all 300.  
(I'll probably pause in the middle to solve the 2021 puzzles when December rolls around!)  

Because I can't "tag" individual files, this is my attempt to track which days have examples of
types of clojure constructs, patterns, and examples so I can quickly find examples when working
on future problems.

2015: Begun...  
2016:   
2017:   
2018:   
2019:   
2020: Nearly complete
